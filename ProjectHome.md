The idea of netkeys is to allow key presses on one computer to be sent across the network to additional computers.

Netkeys has been mainly designed for use in flight simulation, where talking in a Teamspeak room (or other communication platforms) via a push-to-talk key is difficult when both hands are needed to control the simulation. However, it is not specific to one "niche," but rather is designed to be extensible and customizable.

Netkeys runs on Windows and Linux.
